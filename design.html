                    The College is an internationally connected creative community of diverse
                    disciplines housed under one roof. We shape our students' futures, preparing
                    them to shape the world through applied knowledge and creativity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The College's art and design courses don't just train you, they promote
                    alternative ways of thinking, making and communicating; they provide you with
                    space, tools and inspiration to develop your creative practice and a clear
                    career path. You'll get expert teaching from active practitioners and
                    researchers who will encourage you to adopt innovative and resourceful
                    approaches that both perceive and create opportunities for better lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will develop your creative practice whilst interacting with your peers in
                    well-equipped studios, making and digital workshops. At the same time, you'll
                    learn professional skills by working on applied briefs facilitated through our
                    links with commercial clients, cultural institutions, businesses and
                    organisations.
